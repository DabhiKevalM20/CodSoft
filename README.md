# CodSoft Internship Projects - Python
This repository contains four Python-based mini-projects developed as part of the CodSoft Internship Program. Each project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts using Python, with both GUI and console applications.

🗂️ Projects Included

task-1
To-Do List Manager
A GUI application that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks with SQLite-based persistence.

task-2
Calculator
A fully functional GUI calculator with square root, power, and clear functionalities.

task-3
Password Generator
A command-line tool to generate strong, random passwords.

task-4
Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A CLI-based interactive game where you play against the computer.


▶️ How to Run the Projects
To run any of these .py files in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Install Python 3.x: Download Python

Install VS Code: Download VS Code

Install the Python extension in VS Code.

Steps
-Open VS Code

-Go to File > Open Folder and open the folder where your project files are located.

-Open the specific .py file you want to run:

-Calculator.py

-PASSWORD_GENERATOR.py

-Rock-Paper-Scissors_Game.py

-To-Do_List.py

-Click on the green Run button at the top right, or press Ctrl + F5 to run the script.

-For GUI-based apps (Calculator and To-Do List), a new window will open.

-For console-based apps, input/output will appear in the Terminal at the bottom.

📘 What I Learned
During the course of building these projects, I gained hands-on experience in:

🔢 Modern Calculator
Building interactive GUI applications using tkinter

Implementing mathematical operations with error handling

Organizing UI components and applying styling for user-friendly design

🔐 Password Generator
Using Python's random and string modules

Applying loops and conditional logic

Handling user input and exceptions

✊ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
Implementing game logic and control structures

Using random for computer choices

Managing loops and user interaction for continuous gameplay

📝 To-Do List Manager
Integrating Python with SQLite using sqlite3

Creating a persistent local database

Building a CRUD-based GUI app (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Working with listboxes, event handling, and multiple GUI components

These projects helped improve my understanding of Python fundamentals, GUI development, file/database management, and real-world application logic.
